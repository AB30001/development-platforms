SheCodes emerges as a pioneering platform committed to bridging this gap by empowering women with crucial coding skills. Founded in October 2017 by Matt Delac, a seasoned full-stack engineer, SheCodes was initially conceived as a small workshop aimed at teaching basic coding to a handful of women. The initiative quickly expanded due to high demand and positive participant feedback, evolving into a substantial, influential program.

As a leader in technological education for women, SheCodes is distinguished by its dynamic approach to learning and its dedication to fostering inclusivity and diversity within the tech community. This case study will explore the inception, growth, and impact of SheCodes, highlighting its contributions to reducing the gender gap in technology and its role in shaping the careers of thousands of women worldwide. Through this examination, we will uncover the strategies employed by SheCodes to not only educate but also inspire and empower women in the field of technology.

## Brief History

- **2017**
The journey of SheCodes began in Lisbon, Portugal, under the leadership of Matt Delac, a seasoned full-stack engineer with a rich background in software development. Matt, whose early academic challenges only fueled his determination to succeed, envisioned a modest goal to teach coding to 10 women. The overwhelming enthusiasm and positive response he received from the initial participants quickly surpassed his expectations, catalyzing the transformation of SheCodes from a mere concept into a thriving enterprise.
- **2020**
The first workshops, branded as SheCodes 1.0, swiftly gained popularity, leading to a rapid expansion in both scope and scale. By early 2020, SheCodes had hosted numerous beginner and advanced coding workshops, including specialized courses like SheCodes Plus and SheCodes React, in cities across Portugal such as Porto and Braga. These workshops were meticulously refined and expanded over time, reflecting the growing expertise and evolving needs of their participants.

- **Fully online platform**
The increasing demand and the desire to reach a broader audience prompted SheCodes to transition to a fully online platform. This strategic move allowed SheCodes to offer its curriculum globally, enabling women from 196 countries to learn to code from the comfort of their homes. The online format includes beginner workshops and three advanced modules, available either individually or as part of a comprehensive package.

## CodePen's Weaknesses

| Feature              | Description                                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Limited Functionality        | While CodePen offers a wide range of features, its functionality may be limited compared to fully-fledged code editors or integrated development environments (IDEs), especially for complex projects requiring advanced tools and configurations. |
| Dependency on Internet Connection  | Since CodePen is a cloud-based platform, users rely on a stable internet connection to access their projects and work on them, which may be inconvenient in areas with poor connectivity.        |
| Privacy Concerns | Privacy concerns may arise among users due to CodePen projects being publicly accessible by default, prompting apprehensions regarding the protection of intellectual property rights, particularly for sensitive or proprietary projects. However, as a CodePen Pro user, you gain the ability to customize these settings accordingly.                  |
| Subscription Costs          | While CodePen offers a free tier with basic features, some advanced functionalities are only available through paid subscription plans, which may be a barrier for users with limited budgets or resources.                  |
| Limited Version Control            | CodePen's version control capabilities are limited compared to dedicated version control systems like Git, which may make it challenging for users to track changes and collaborate on larger projects effectively.    |

## Market Comparison

CodePen distinguishes itself with its vibrant community, intuitive interface, and broad feature set, making it a preferred platform over competitors like [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) and [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/). It shines in its support for modern front-end frameworks and real-time code previews, ideal for prototyping and project sharing. However, the platform's extensive feature set might overwhelm beginners, and access to advanced features necessitates a Pro subscription, a potential disadvantage against simpler or free alternatives. Yet, CodePen's unique combination of community engagement and development tools makes it an indispensable resource for web developers and educators alike.
