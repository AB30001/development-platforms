## Introduction

Gitlab is a web based development platform that provides a set of useful tools like project hosting through git and managing code through versions. It's being claimed that GitLab offers a complete [DevOps](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/devops/) platform that can support the entire lifecycle of a project.

## Brief History

- 2011: Co-Founder Dmitriy Zaporozhets started the development of Gitlab.
- 2012: First version of the GitLab CI was made.
- 2014: GitLab was incorporated.
- 2015: GitLab participated in [Y Combinator](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2015/03/04/gitlab-is-part-of-the-y-combinator-family/).
- 2018: Started focusing on DevOps offerings.

## Main Features

GitLab does most of the things that we are already familiar with in other development platforms like GitHub, BitBucket and SourceForge just to mention a few. However, the key difference is that GitLab provides us with a set of tools that is tailored for [DevOps](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/devops/) development. These tools help efficiency in development and helps developers catch mistakes early. Some of the key features that GitLab provides are:


| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Version Cotrol | GitLab is built to work with Git, this helps keep track of changes. |
| Web-Based Interface | GitLab provides a web interface that allows users to manage their repository. Everything from creating and cloning to code review and issue managment. |
| [CI/CD](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd/) | GitLab has many [CI/CD](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd/) features, helping developers test the process of building, testing and deploying their applications. |
