## Introduction

GitLab stands as a feature rich web-based development platform, offering a suite of essential tools for efficient project management, version control through Git and comprehensive code management. Developed in 2011 by Ukrainian Dmitriy Zaporozhets, GitLab was initially conceived to address the collaborative needs of his team. Since then, it has evolved into a complete [DevOps](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/devops/) platform, seamlessly supporting the entire project lifecycle. This all-encompassing solution empowers teams to streamline development processes, foster collaboration, and ensure effective version control from inception to deployment. 

## Brief History

- 2011: Co-Founder Dmitriy Zaporozhets started the development of Gitlab.
- 2012: First version of the GitLab CI was made.
- 2014: GitLab was incorporated.
- 2015: GitLab participated in [Y Combinator](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2015/03/04/gitlab-is-part-of-the-y-combinator-family/).
- 2017: Database admin accidentally deleted the production database in the aftermath of a cyber attack.
- 2018: Started focusing on DevOps offerings.
- 2023: GitLab becomes an AI-driven [DevSecOps](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/devsecops/) solution with GitLab version 16.0.

## Main Features

GitLab does most of the things that we are already familiar with in other development platforms like GitHub, BitBucket and SourceForge just to mention a few. However, the key difference is that GitLab provides us with a set of tools that is tailored for [DevOps](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/devops/) development. These tools help efficiency in development and helps developers catch mistakes early. Some of the key features that GitLab provides are:


| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Version Control | GitLab is built to work with Git, this helps keep track of changes. |
| Web-Based Interface | GitLab provides a web interface that allows users to manage their repository. Everything from creating and cloning to code review and issue management. |
| [CI/CD](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd/) | GitLab has many [CI/CD](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd/) features, helping developers test the process of building, testing and deploying their applications. |
| Issue Tracking | Gitlab has tools for tracking issues and managing projects through tasks directly within the platform. |
| Wiki and Documentation | GitLab provides a wiki feature allowing teams to create and maintain documentation intended to keep a good flow of information and best practices. |
| Security and Compliance | GitLab offers features for security scanning and compliance monitoring, through these it's possible to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the codebase, improving the overall security. |
| Self-Managed and Cloud-Based | GitLab let's you choose between using it as a self-hosted solution or a cloud based service, this creates for better flexibility for the teams based on their needs. |

## Market Comparison

Let's take a look at some comparisons between GitLab and it's biggest counterpart GitHub:

| Feature | GitLab | GitHub |
|   ---     |  :---: |  :---: |
| Access Control | More flexible settings for access permissions. | Simple read/write access option. |
| Pricing | Many Features for both public and private for free | Free public repositories with limited functions |
| Self-Hosting | Possible on your own server | Cloud-Based only |
| Built in CI/CD | Tightly integrated CI/CD capabilities | GitHub Actions provides CI/CD solutions that automates workflows. |
| Issue Tracking | Integrated Kanban board, issue tracking and project management | Robust issue tracking and GitHub Projects for managing projects | 
| Security Features | Security scanning, container scanning and code analysis | Dependency scanning, secret scanning and code scanning |
| Container Registry | Integrated container registry in the platform for both [Docker](https://aws.amazon.com/docker/) images and other formats | Host and Manage [Docker](https://aws.amazon.com/docker/) images |
| Community and Open Source | For Open Source projects and has a strong community | Large active community and it's widely used for open source |
| User Interface | Feature rich and extensive, can be harder to learn | Clean, user-friendly and easy to use 

## Conclusion

GitLab seems in every way like a more premium offering than competitors, it delivers a full suite fo useful tools for he whole development process while still remaining free for the average open source user. Things like self-hosting and CI/CD tools makes it an easy choice for those seeking the DevOps development cycle. It does however not go without it's own set of downsides, like it's significantly slower UI and it's lack of some of the enterprise-level software development features.
