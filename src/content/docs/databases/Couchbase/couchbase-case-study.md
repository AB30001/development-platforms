## Introduction

Couchbase is a open source NoSql JSON document database platform, that offers high-performance, flexibility, scalability, and speed. It achieves its high performance by using in-memory caching, which allows it to be much faster than other known relational databases such as MySQL,and PostgreSQL. It also performs significantly faster than other NoSQL databases like MongoDB. Couchbase also uses N1QL which is a query language that is similar to SQL, which makes it easier for people who are already familiar with SQL, where as MongoDB uses its own unique query language called MongoDB query language (MQL).

## Brief History

- 2009: NorthScale and CouchOne Inc was founded. CouchOne Inc developed and provided financial support for Apache CouchDB, a open source, document database.
- 2010: NorthScale got $5 million in funding from Accel Partners and North Bridge Venture Partners, and a $10 million investment by Mayfield Fund, and later same year NorthScale was renamed to Membase.
- 2011: Membase and CouchOne merged together and became CouchBase Inc. Goal with CouchBase Inc was to build NoSQL document-oriented database system, which is easily scalable, and high-performing.

## Main Features

Couchbase is a powerful NoSQL database platform, offering its own unique advantages, and making database management as easy and cost-efficient as possible. Here is the main features of this database system:

- **SQL++:** Use of SQL-like query language to work with JSON data. This shortens learning curve for developers already familiar with SQL, and let them use the flexibility and speed of JSON with along with their SQL-skills. SQL++ also includes JOIN operations, which is often not present in other NoSQL database systems.

- **Key-value:** Saving data as items with unique key, and value. The value can be either binary or JSON, and will be identified by a unique key, this can be defined by the developer or application when the item is saved. This allows for as efficient as possible data-lookup.

- **In-cache Memory:** The most used data and indexes are cached in-memory for faster reads, writes are also performed in-memory and can be replicated, presisted synchronously or asynchronously, which ensures consistency.

- **Full-text search:** Use of Integrated JSON search, that gives the developers ability to perform powerful searches without the need for any third-party software. Developers/Users can find content in the database by criterias such as text, latitude, longitude, and vector embeddings. Text search indexes are predefined to make the search faster than traditional field-based database scans.

- **Real-time Analytics:** Ablility to perform complex BI and fast, low latency analtytical queries on the data. Since modern adaptive applications require operational and transactional data to create streamlined experience, the apps needs to work in real-time. Couchbase solve this problem by converging operational data and real-time analytics in one platform.'

- **Eventing:** Couchbase offers eventing service that offers capabilities such as real-time data mutation management, alert setting, and data change propagation without the need for third-party tool installment. This improves business workflows using an event-condition-action model, and reduces costs and technical barriers.

- **Cross Data Center Replication (XDCR):** a feature of Couchbase that automaticlly replicates data across data center, cloud regions and cloud providers. This ensures data recovery in case of a disaster, allows data to be as close as possible to the user, improves the speed, performance, and ensures that the data keeps being available even if one of the centers is down.

## Couchbase Services

- **Couchbase Capella:** which is a fully managed cloud Database-as-a-Service.

- **Couchbase Server:** which is a self-hosted database server which can be downloaded and installed in various operation systems such as Windows, Linux and Mac.

- **Couchbase Mobile** which run as a standalone embedded database on mobile, desktop, and edge devices.

- **Autonoumous Operator:** which is used to run easily within Kubernetes, that provides a Couchbase specific API for managing database clusters.
