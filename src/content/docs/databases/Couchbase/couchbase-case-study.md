## Introduction

Couchbase is a open source NoSql json document database, that offers high-performance, flexibility, scalability, and speed. It achieves its high performance by using in-memory caching, which allows it to be much faster than other known relational databases such as MySQL,and PostgreSQL. It also performs significantly faster than other NoSQL databases like MongoDB. Couchbase also uses N1QL which is a query language that is similar to SQL, which makes it easier for people who are already familiar with SQL, where as MongoDB uses its own unique query language called MongoDB query language (MQL).
